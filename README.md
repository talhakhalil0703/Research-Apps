# ResearchCode
Code for research that I use to automate my workflow.
Auto figure creating script, that creates matlab figures for data that it finds by parsing through a folder. Also cleans and filters the signal. It does what I used to do in 12 hours, in 30 minutes!

Gui.py launches a graphical user interface which is used to launch a subset of scripts that can be used to analyze the output of Auto Figure, and then collect the data from said output. Using that data it create figures showcasing section by section how the results differ, and also creates an excel file for the raw data so that it can be easily accessed for further analysis.
