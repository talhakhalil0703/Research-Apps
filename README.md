# ResearchCode
Code for research that I use to automate my workflow.

AutoFooof: Script that creates fooof_objects which can be used by CreateFigures for further analysis. Also cleans and filters the signal. It does what I used to do in 12 hours, in 30 minutes!

CreateFigures: Gui.py launches a graphical user interface which is used to launch a subset of scripts that can be used to analyze the output of AutoFooof, and then collect the data from said output. Using that data it creates figures showcasing section by section how the results differ, and also creates an excel file for the raw data so that it can be easily accessed for further analysis.
